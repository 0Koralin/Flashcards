## Flashcards

## Lab 1

### App Description
First “draft” of the flashcard app, built in Xcode on iPhone 11.
The question and answer labels toggle when they’re tapped.
There are also 3 buttons beneath acting as multiple choice answers. Only the correct answer makes the question label toggles to the other label. Tapping the wrong answer hides the button.
